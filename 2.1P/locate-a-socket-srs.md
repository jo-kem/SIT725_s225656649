## 1. Introduction
💬 _Provides an overview of the document and orients the reader to the system being specified._

➥ Briefly summarize the SRS’s purpose, product scope, intended audience, and how the document is organized. Do not include details here; reference the relevant sections instead.

### 1.1 Document Purpose
💬 _Clarifies why this SRS exists, what it contains, and who should use it._

➥ State the purpose of the SRS in 2–4 sentences. Name the primary audiences (e.g., product, engineering, QA, security, compliance, operations) and how they use it across the software lifecycle.

💡 Tips:
- Emphasize that the SRS defines what the system must do, not how it will do it.
- Mention related documents (vision/scope, architecture, roadmap, contracts) if relevant.

### 1.2 Product Scope
💬 _Defines the software product’s purpose, boundaries, and relationship to business goals._

➥ Identify the product by name and version/release. In 3–5 sentences, describe its primary purpose, key capabilities, and intended outcomes. Clearly list inclusions and exclusions when this SRS covers part of a larger system. Focus on the “what” and “why.”

💡 Tips:
- Connect capabilities to business objectives and reference a separate vision/scope document if relevant.
- Include a simple diagram if it clarifies boundaries within a larger system.

### 1.3 Document Overview
💬 _Brief guide to the structure of the SRS so readers can quickly find what they need._

➥ Summarize what each major section covers (Product Overview, Requirements, Verification, Appendixes), note any document conventions, and mention how updates and revision history are managed.

💡 Tips:
- Keep to 3–5 sentences focusing on navigation and conventions.

### 1.4 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
➥ Help readers understand specialized terms and notation by providing a glossary of domain terms, acronyms, and abbreviations used in the SRS.

💡 Tips:
- Include terms that impact interpretation of requirements (e.g., “user,” “tenant,” “near real-time”).
- Keep entries alphabetized and consistent across the document set.

| Term | Definition                                                                                                                   |

## 2. Product Overview
💬 _Provides background and context influencing the product’s requirements._

### 2.1 Product Perspective
💬 _Places the product within a larger ecosystem or lineage._

➥ Describe context and origin of the product, whether this is a new product, replacement, or member of a family. If part of a larger system, briefly explain relationships, external interfaces, and key dependencies. Include details on ownership, service level agreements (SLAs), and support models.

💡 Tips:
- Highlight upstream/downstream systems and ownership boundaries.
- A high-level context diagram may help to orient the reader.

### 2.2 Product Functions
💬 _High-level summary of what the product enables users or systems to do._

➥ Provide a concise overview of the major functional areas/features. Defer detailed behaviors, data, and edge cases to Section 3.

💡 Tips:
- 5–10 bullets are often sufficient at this level, grouping related functions logically.
- Include a top-level data flow or use case diagram if helpful.

### 2.3 User Characteristics
💬 _Defines the user groups and the attributes that affect requirements._

➥ Identify user classes, roles, and personas, noting expertise, access levels, frequency of use, accessibility needs, and goals.

💡 Tips:
- Define user classes by behavior, not just titles.
- Note localization and accessibility considerations that affect UI/UX requirements.

### 2.4 Product Constraints
💬 _Defines contextual limitations or conditions shaping design and implementation._

➥ Describe constraints such as mandated interfaces, technology stacks, regulatory obligations, QoS baselines, hardware limitations, AI/ML model families, and organizational policies.

💡 Tips:
- State constraints as verifiable "must" statements (e.g., “must use FIPS 140–3 validated crypto modules”).
- Distinguish external/internal and mandatory/preferred constraints.
- Avoid design decisions unless truly binding.

📝 Note:
Requirements (Section 3) defines verifiable system obligations—specific behaviors or qualities the system shall exhibit in order to satisfy limits described in this section.

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
💬 _External assumed factors or conditions, as opposed to known facts, that the project relies on._

➥ List assumptions about environment, hardware, usage patterns, third-party components/services, and organizational support. List dependencies on external systems, libraries, or teams. For each, indicate potential impact if proven false.

💡 Tips:
- Link assumptions to risk register with owner and mitigation when available.


## 3. Specific Requirements
💬 _This section specifies **verifiable** requirements of the software product to enable design and testing._

➥ State requirements to a level of detail sufficient for design and verification. Use unique identifiers, consistent keywords (shall/should/may), and clear conditions. Describe inputs, processing in response, and outputs where applicable. Reference the relevant 2.3 Product Constraints that the requirement addresses.

📃 Template (applies to **all** requirements):
```markdown
- ID: REQ-FUNC-001
- Title: Short title, representative of the requirement...
- Statement: The system shall...
- Rationale: ...
- Acceptance Criteria: ...
- Verification Method: Test | Analysis | Inspection | Demonstration | Other
- More Information: Additional context. Links to related artifacts.
```

Requirement ID schema and traceability:
- ID format: REQ-[AREA]-[NNN]-[VER] (optional -[VER] if versioned), where AREA ∈ {FUNC, INT, PERF, SEC, REL, AVAIL, OBS, COMP, INST, BUILD, DIST, MAINT, REUSE, PORT, COST, DEAD, POC, CM, ML}.
- Uniqueness: IDs must be unique and immutable; changes increment -[VER] and are recorded in Revision History.
- Traceability: Each test artifact may reference the requirement ID.

💡 Tips:
- Make each requirement testable and unambiguous, using standard metrics and avoiding vague terms (e.g., “user-friendly,” “fast”).

### 3.1 External Interfaces
💬 _Specifies all external inputs and outputs, covering both required and provided interfaces._

➥ Provide interface definitions sufficient for implementation and test.

💡 Tips:
- Use interface control documents or schemas where appropriate and reference them here.

#### 3.1.1 User Interfaces
💬 _Describes how users interact with the system at a logical level._

➥ Define UI elements, flows, and standards to be followed (style guides, accessibility guidelines). Include layout constraints, common controls (e.g., help, search), keyboard shortcuts, error/empty-state behavior, and localization. Keep visual designs in a separate UI specification and reference them.

💡 Tips:
- Reference accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG) and platform-specific guidelines.
- Consider organizing into subcategories for clarity: Usability/Accessibility (inputs/outputs and dialogs to fit user abstractions, abilities, and expectations), and Convenience.

#### 3.1.2 Hardware Interfaces
💬 _Details interactions with physical devices and platforms._

➥ Specify (un)supported device types, data/control signals, electrical or mechanical characteristics if relevant, and communication protocols. Include timing, throughput, and reliability expectations.

💡 Tips:
- Reference applicable hardware specs and certification requirements.

#### 3.1.3 Software Interfaces
💬 _Defines integrations with other software components and services._

➥ List connected systems (name and version), required or provided services/APIs, data items/messages exchanged, communication styles/protocols, and limit/error/timeout semantics. Identify shared data and ownership.

💡 Tips:
- Capture versioning and backward compatibility policies.
- Define authentication/authorization expectations for each integration.

#### 3.1.4 Communication Interfaces


### 3.2 Functional Requirements
💬 _Specifies the externally observable behaviors and functions the software shall provide._

➥ Organize functional requirements by feature, use case, or service. For each, describe triggers/inputs, processing/logic (at a black-box level), outputs, and error conditions. For AI behaviors, define determinism bounds (e.g., temperature), refusal criteria, safety rules, and human review points.

💡 Tips:
- Include edge cases and negative scenarios for completeness.
- For AI features, include fallback behaviors and thresholds for abstention.

### 3.3 Non-Functional Requirements
💬 _Quality attributes that constrain or qualify functional behavior._

➥ Use specific metrics, ranges, and conditions.

💡 Tips:
- When a quality applies only to a subset of functions, reference the related requirement IDs.
- Provide rationale when targets cut across functions to aid trade-off decisions.

#### 3.3.1 Performance
💬 _Response time, throughput, and resource usage expectations._

➥ Specify timing relationships, peak/steady-state loads, and performance targets under expected conditions. Include measurement methods, environments, and acceptance thresholds. Note any real-time constraints.

💡 Tips:
- Include scalability targets and capacity planning assumptions.
- Consider organizing into subcategories for clarity: Time (latency, throughput, etc.) and Space (memory, storage, bandwidth, etc.).

#### 3.3.2 Security
💬 _Defines the protection of data, identities, and operations._

➥ Define authentication, authorization, data protection (in transit/at rest), auditing, and privacy requirements. Address abuse/misuse and external attacks (e.g., injection, data exfiltration, or service compromise), and include secure defaults and incident response requirements.

💡 Tips:
- Distinguish mandatory controls vs. recommended practices.
- Consider organizing into subcategories for clarity: Safety (harmful external outcomes), Confidentiality (disclose data to unauthorized parties), Privacy (private data disclosed without consent), Integrity (data modified without authorization), and Availability (authorized data or resources made available when requested).

📝 Note:
Place generic security controls here (3.3.2), and cross-reference from supported controls as necessary:
- Use 3.1 External Interfaces for interface-level validation and secure protocols.
- Use 3.4 Compliance for regulatory/contractual obligations and audit evidence.
- Use 3.6 AI/ML for model-specific runtime protections and data governance.

#### 3.3.3 Reliability
💬 _Ability to consistently perform as specified._

➥ Specify reliability metrics and techniques (e.g., MTBF, error budgets, retry/backoff, idempotency, redundancy). Define conditions under which reliability is assessed and any failover behaviors. Define graceful degradation (e.g., fallback components, cached results, AI/ML deterministic heuristics), timeout/abstain policies, and rollback to previous versions.

#### 3.3.4 Availability
💬 _System uptime and readiness to deliver service._

➥ Define availability targets, maintenance windows, and mechanisms like checkpointing, recovery, and restart. Include geographical/zone redundancy if applicable.

💡 Tips:
- Express availability in terms meaningful to users (e.g., downtime per month) and tie to SLAs/SLOs.
- Capture scale-out/in behavior affecting availability (e.g., max failover time, quorum constraints).

#### 3.3.5 Observability
💬 _Ability to understand system state and behavior in production through telemetry._

➥ Define requirements for logs, metrics, traces, and profiling: events/fields, cardinality limits, sampling, retention, and privacy/PII handling in telemetry. Specify standard labels (e.g., service, version, tenant), correlation/trace IDs propagation, and redaction policies. State SLO-aligned alert rules, dashboards, and ownership.

💡 Tips:
- Avoid maintenance-process details (keep runbooks and on-call policies in 3.5.4 Maintainability).

#### 3.3.6 Useability
💬 _Ability to understand system state and behavior in production through telemetry._

➥ Define requirements for logs, metrics, traces, and profiling: events/fields, cardinality limits, sampling, retention, and privacy/PII handling in telemetry. Specify standard labels (e.g., service, version, tenant), correlation/trace IDs propagation, and redaction policies. State SLO-aligned alert rules, dashboards, and ownership.

💡 Tips:
- Avoid maintenance-process details (keep runbooks and on-call policies in 3.5.4 Maintainability).


## 4. Supporting Information
💬 _Optional supporting material that aids understanding without being normative._

➥ Include glossaries, data dictionaries, models/diagrams, sample datasets, or change-impact analyses that support the main sections. Reference rather than duplicate content when possible.

💡 Tips:
- Keep appendixes organized and referenced from the main text.

• System architecture diagrams: <high-level system architecture diagram,
deployment architecture diagram, sequence diagrams>
• Use cases, Use case diagrams
• API documentation (for third-party integrations).
• Legal compliance
• References
